<h2>🟢 Task 3: College Event Feedback Analysis</h2>

<h3>📌 Project Overview</h3>
<p>
Task 3 focused on analyzing student feedback collected through surveys after attending college events or courses.
The objective was to evaluate student satisfaction levels, identify strengths and areas for improvement,
and provide actionable recommendations using data analysis and visualization.
</p>

<h3>📁 Dataset Description</h3>
<p>
The dataset consists of rating-based survey responses where students evaluated various aspects of the event/course
on a scale of 1 to 5.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Well versed with the subject</li>
    <li>Explains concepts in an understandable way</li>
    <li>Use of presentations</li>
    <li>Degree of difficulty of assignments</li>
    <li>Solves doubts willingly</li>
    <li>Structuring of the course</li>
    <li>Provides support for students going above and beyond</li>
    <li>Course recommendation based on relevance</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠 Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</li>
    <li>Google Colab</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
</ul>

<h3>📊 Analysis Performed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
    <li>Average rating analysis per feedback parameter</li>
    <li>Overall student satisfaction score calculation</li>
    <li>Rating-based sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative)</li>
    <li>Correlation analysis between feedback parameters</li>
    <li>Word cloud generation to highlight key feedback dimensions</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔍 Key Insights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Students showed high satisfaction with concept clarity and subject knowledge</li>
    <li>Assignment difficulty emerged as a common area for improvement</li>
    <li>Strong correlation observed between doubt-solving support and course recommendation</li>
    <li>Majority of students fall under the "Satisfied" or "Highly Satisfied" category</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠 Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide additional guidance and resources for challenging assignments</li>
    <li>Maintain strong student support and doubt-solving practices</li>
    <li>Improve presentation quality to enhance engagement</li>
    <li>Collect feedback periodically to ensure continuous improvement</li>
</ul>

<h3>📄 Deliverable</h3>
<p>
✔ Cleaned dataset and analysis notebook (Google Colab) <br>
✔ Visualizations including charts, heatmaps, and word cloud <br>
✔ Insights and actionable recommendations
